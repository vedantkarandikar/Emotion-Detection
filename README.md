# Emotion-Detection

## How to?
- Download '68 point predictor' and place in dir
- Run main.py to train and save the model
- Then run predict.py to predict using the saved model

# How it works?
- Neurohive has an amazing [article](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) about the VGG16 model
- VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition”.
- Most unique thing about VGG16 is that instead of having a large number of hyper-parameter they focused on having convolution layers of 3x3 filter with a stride 1 and always used same padding and maxpool layer of 2x2 filter of stride 2. It follows this arrangement of convolution and max pool layers consistently throughout the whole architecture.
- In the end it has two fully connected + ReLU layers followed by a softmax(for classification)

## Architecture
[Article](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) for complete article
- The input to cov1 layer is of fixed size 224 x 224 RGB image. The image is passed through a stack of convolutional (conv.) layers, where the filters were used with a very small receptive field: 3×3 (which is the smallest size to capture the notion of left/right, up/down, center). In one of the configurations, it also utilizes 1×1 convolution filters, which can be seen as a linear transformation of the input channels (followed by non-linearity). The convolution stride is fixed to 1 pixel; the spatial padding of conv. layer input is such that the spatial resolution is preserved after convolution, i.e. the padding is 1-pixel for 3×3 conv. layers. Spatial pooling is carried out by five max-pooling layers, which follow some of the conv.  layers (not all the conv. layers are followed by max-pooling). Max-pooling is performed over a 2×2 pixel window, with stride 2.

- Three Fully-Connected (FC) layers follow a stack of convolutional layers (which has a different depth in different architectures): the first two have 4096 channels each, the third performs 1000-way ILSVRC classification and thus contains 1000 channels (one for each class). The final layer is the soft-max layer. The configuration of the fully connected layers is the same in all networks.

- All hidden layers are equipped with the rectification (ReLU) non-linearity. It is also noted that none of the networks (except for one) contain Local Response Normalisation (LRN), such normalization does not improve the performance on the ILSVRC dataset, but leads to increased memory consumption and computation time.
